                <h1>Skiing</h1>
                <p>In addition to computer science, I love to ski! I have been skiing as long as I have been walking. Below is a map of the mountains I have skied.  I plan to continue adding to this list and potentially ski on every continent. Please let me know if you have any skiing suggestions.</p>

                <h1>Road Trip</h1>
                <p>Recently, I went on a road trip from Chicago, IL to Pebble Beach, CA, which was a massive undertaking.  I defintely came to appreciate the landcape of the US much more and how big the US really is. However, being stuck in a car for just under 40 hours is a little traumatizing. Overall, it was an experience I will never forget.</p>
