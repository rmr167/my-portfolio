        <p>Recently, I went on a road trip from Chicago, IL to Pebble Beach, CA. It a massive undertaking and was both amazing and horrible.  I defintely came to appreciate the landcape of the US much more and how big the US really is. However, being stuck in a car for just under 40 hours is a little traumatizing. </p>
