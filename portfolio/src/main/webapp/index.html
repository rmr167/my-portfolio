                <p>My name is Rae.  I am a rising junior at Caltech where I major in Computer Science. I love coding. The mixture of logic and creativity fits with my brain. I also love teaching others about computer science.  The moment when a student figures out how to fix their bug is such a happy one. This past year I was a teaching assistant for CS 1 (Introduction to Computer Programming) and I hope to continue being a TA next year.  I also plan on continuing tutoring other students. At Caltech, I enjoy being a tour guide. Caltech has such a beautiful campus so it is easy to show it off. It is one of the nicest ways to earn some extra cash on campus. In terms of extracurriculars, I am a member of the Society of Women Engineers and I am on house leadership.  Caltech has an interesting residential system.  Each of the eight houses on campus have unique personalities and traditions.  Last year, I was on the social team of Page House and this year I am a representative of Fleming House. Outside of my schoolwork and extracurriculars, I enjoy taking spin classes at the gym, going to the beach, and hanging out with friends.</p>
